These are the Jupyter notebooks for Kirby & Tamariz (2021). One has the simulations in it, and the other some horrendous data frame mangling to get nicer graphs from the results for the paper itself. The code is copyright (c) 2019-2021 Simon Kirby, with contributions from Kenny Smith (developed from code for the Simulating Language course at the University of Edinburgh).
